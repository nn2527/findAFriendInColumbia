<!--Idea : To make a platform for Columbia students to find friends on campus who they share similar interest(s) with. First the user has to write down their detail to get added to the database (can be seen in the console) and then write keywords to fetch names of people who have similar interests from the temporary database (array!). Since I do not know backend yet, there is no way I could store the information that users submit after they leave but hopefully, I will at least create a static database (through cards) on the same webpage which fetches similar keywords when the Find Friends button is pushed. The steps to do that have been roughly mentioned as comments in my js -->
